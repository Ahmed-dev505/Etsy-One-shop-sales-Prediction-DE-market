It was handed over to a secondary delivery service that was unnamed on the 4th of November 2021. I have not been provided  information to track it and I am not sure I am ever going to receive it.

Edit: I did finally receive the item. For anyone not aware if the post office hands the package off to another delivery service you have to contact the person who sent the package for the information. I did contact the seller and was referred back to the post office. Hopefully if it happens again in the future the next customer will get a more prompt response. The Torc is beautiful and looks to be a a good quality."

As always, It was nicely wrapped and fast shipped from Germany (8 days). It is a full size striker, 4"" in length, and an ample loop for user who has large finger size. My fingers are relatively small, however I still feel it firm in my hand, so I can say there is not any problem at all as far as ergonomic feature is concerned.

The most interesting part that first draws my attention is the thickness of its shining striking face, at least it is 7 mm thick, and to my astonishment and surprising pleasure, it greatly enhanced the sparkling performance. Using a flake of Texas flint, and with just some slight strikes, showers of far flung bright sparks happened.

Great Item! Great seller!"

The design is adapted from the famous Chessel Down throat, although this features a cut down version of the zoomorphic frieze (outermost motifs are cut from this design) and is the same on both sides, whereas the original had a very crude silver sheet to form the back, with runes scratched in. This is a rather lovely adaptation of the style represented by the Chessel Down sword. 

However, it is quite a small piece and likely in most cases will not be compatible with replica Anglo-Saxon sword blades, for use as a scabbard fitting. If you want to use this piece with a sword, be sure to check the measurements thoroughly!!  

Nb.  Prompt dispatch, well packaged, superb service as always."

I took it to the Icelandic national museum where there is a bunch of very similar chapes and this one compares very well to the originals. Cannot recommend this item highly enough. One thing to keep in mind is that the sides of this chape are 'V' shaped while most original chapes' edges were were 'U' shaped. This is not a problem with a sharp sword where the scabbard has a'<>' shaped blade channel but I bought this chape for a reenactment sword which has flat 3mm edges and a rectangular blade channel so I had to shave the wooden scabbard core to within a couple of millimetres of the blade channel corners which makes the wood core weak. If you are buying this for a blunt sword make the wooden core 5-7 cm longer so you don't have to weaken the wooden core as much.

A charming and faithful reproduction of the Uppland pendant. 

My one issue with this piece, if I had one, would be that there is no designated loop to thread a string or chain through; one must thread the string or chain through the circle of the figure's horns, which sometimes prevents the pendant from sitting flat against the chest. This is a minor issue and does not detract from my satisfaction with the item."

This Blade is made out of Very thick steel, making it very sturdy and making it useful for just about anything Bushcraft.
The Bevels and Angles were near perfect and it resembles a Scandy grind. It arrived very sharp and I decided to make a handle just as beautiful as the blade.

For more knife products visit my Facebook page ""F-Knives"" and you can see a video on how I made the handle.

Thank you very much once again for supplying quality and affordable blades."

The only fly in the ointment is that it comes at 135 c.m. I emailed the company to ask to have the belt lengthened if they would, It’s not that the belt won’t fit( but it is cutting it close.) I just prefer the 148 c.m belt for the way it hangs. At any rate, I was told; “No problem”..I said Great!! Thank you Very much!
The belt arrived, and it was a 135c.m. And no response from email, when I tried to contact the seller. When before the lines of communication had been open. Disappointed at that level. But if you ask for the standard length, there should be no problem on that level. To any who plan to buy one, ( and I give no caveats against doing so). I would email often concerning whatever change deviating from the standard length that you have requested. All and all, good work,"

I will definitely buy from them in the future.
 I really can only think of one thing I would change, and that would be to have smaller diameter ones for women's necks, as mine is a little bit big in that regard. It's not really a big issue and will vary per person, but may be something for the creator to consider in the future. 
Just for reference I am 5'10"" tall and average weight Dutch and Danish woman ..ie not small or petite  but not overweight. Basically I know that there are many women that are smaller than us Nordic/Germanic ladies. 
 ps: I didn't give it all stars as I like to save one for one of a kind or very high quality items."

Easy to apply, preserves the texture and colour of metal, appears to be safe for even the softer gemstones, and since I applied it to my silver jewellery, haven't seen a hint of tarnish (and usually, my silver starts visibly tarnishing again within a few days of being cleaned, even if it hasn't been worn)!

I was hopeful, but not convinced of the claims made for this product when I bought this, but so far, I am a believer. If it lasts as long as it claims (or even half as long), then it will be well worth the price.

Also, great communication from the seller, who has been very patient with my frequent messages for shipping updates, etc. A pleasure to do business with.

Thank you for making it available!"

 A thicker, more loosely woven wool cloak is better suited to such a heavy-duty brooch.

I finally got sick of it and gave it away and looked all over for the online shop AND I FOUND IT (thank goodness)
This is my favorite little dagger and I use it for so many things :D
I will be buying another for my boyfriend soon :)
